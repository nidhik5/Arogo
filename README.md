This repository hosts the **BiomedCLIP Data Pipeline**, which automatically downloads and processes a set of articles from the PubMed Central Open Access dataset. The end result is a JSONL file containing figures and associated captions, which can be used to train the **BiomedCLIP** model.

For a hands-on demonstration, refer to the [example notebook](run_pmc15_pipeline.ipynb).


## Environment Setup 

```bash
# it is recmmended to use a virtual environment but not required
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
